    <div class="text">Flamenco (Spanish pronunciation: [flaˈmeŋko]), in its strictest sense, is an art form based on the various folkloric music traditions of southern Spain, originating in the culture and traditions of the Calé Roma, commonly known in Spanish as Gitanos, of the region of Andalusia, but also having a historical presence in Extremadura and Murcia. In a wider sense, the term is used to refer to a variety of Spanish and Roma musical style.

<font color= red>The oldest record of flamenco music dates to 1774 in the book Las Cartas Marruecas by José Cadalso. Although Flamenco is often associated to the Gitanos of the Romani ethnicity who have contributed significantly to its origination and development, its style is uniquely Andalusian and flamenco artists have historically included Spaniards of both gitano and non-gitano heritage.<br><br></font>


<font color= green>The development of flamenco over the past two centuries is well documented: "the theatre movement of sainetes (one-act plays) and tonadillas, popular song books and song sheets, customs, studies of dances, and toques, perfection, newspapers, graphic documents in paintings and engravings. ... in continuous evolution together with rhythm, the poetic stanzas, and the ambiance" (Ríos Ruiz 1997,[page needed]).<br></font>


<font color= cyan>There is no doubt that flamenco is rooted in various Andalusian popular musical styles, although its origins is the subject of many hypotheses which may or may not have ideological implications and none of which are necessarily mutually exclusive. The most widespread is that flamenco was developed through the cross-cultural interchange among the various groups which coexisted in Andalusia's lower classes, combining southern Spain's indigenous, Byzantine, Moorish, and Romani musical traditions.<br><br></font>


<font color= purple>The word flamenco, referring to the artistic genre that is known under that name, it dates back to the mid-19th century. There is no certainty of its etymology, so several hypotheses have been raised:<br>


<font color=gold>Because Gitanos are also known as flamencos: in 1881 Demófilo, in the first study on flamenco, argued that this genre owes its name to the fact that its main cultivators, the Gitanos, were frequently known under that denomination. In 1841 George Borrow in his book Los Zíncali: Los gitanos de España had already collected this popular denomination, which reinforces Demofilo's argument.
Gitanos or egiptanos is the name given in Spain both in the past and in the present to what we call in English gypsies, although they are also known as "new Castilians", "Germans" and "flamingos" ...</font>
<br>


There is no certainty as to why the Gitanos were called flamencos, however, there are numerous reports that point to a slang origin, placing the term flamenco within the lexicon of the germanía. This theory holds that flamenco derives from flamancia, a word that comes from "flama" and which in German refers to the fiery temperament of the gypsies. In the same sense, the dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy says that "flamenco" colloquially means "cool or insolent", an example of which is the phrase "to become flamenco". In a similar meaning, the term flamenco is used as a synonym of 'knife' and of gresca or algazara by Juan Ignacio González del Castillo, in his sainete "The boastful soldier" (c. 1785). However, Serafín Estébanez Calderón who in his "Andalusian scenes" (1847) provides the first descriptions of flamenco situations, did not use that name to describe them.</font>
<br>

<font color= red>By parallelism with the wading bird of the same name: some hypotheses relate the origin of the name of the flamenco genus with the wading birds of the same name. One of them says that flamenco receives that name because the appearance and body language of its interpreters reminds them of these birds. Marius Schneider, on the other hand, defends that the origin of the term may be in the name of these birds, but not in their resemblance to the style of the bailaores but in that the mode of my, which is the predominant one in the Flemish repertoire, is related in medieval symbology, among other animals, with the flamingo.</font>
<br>

<font color= orange>Because its origin is in Flanders: another number of hypotheses link the origin of the term with Flanders. According to Felipe Pedrell flamenco came to Spain from those lands at the time of Carlos V, hence its name.[12] Some add that in the dances that were organized to welcome the said monarch, they cheered with the cry of "dance to flamenco!" However, the term "flamenco" linked to music and dance emerged in the mid-19th century, several centuries after that event.
Because it is the music of the fellah min gueir ard, the landless Moorish peasants: according to the notary and politician Blas Infante, the term "flamenco" comes from the expression Andalusian fellah min gueir ard (فلاح من غير أرض), which means "landless peasant".<br>
 According to him, many Moorish s were integrated into the gypsy communities, with which they shared their character of ethnic minority outside the dominant culture. Infante supposes that flamenco singing must have arisen in that breeding ground, as a manifestation of the pain that these people felt for the annihilation of their culture.</font>
<br>
<font color= grey> However, Blas Infante does not provide any historical documentary source that supports this hypothesis and, taking into account the strong defense that he made throughout his life of an agrarian reform in Andalusia, To alleviate the miserable situation of the Andalusian day laborer of his time, this interpretation seems more ideological and political than historical or musicological. However, Father García Barrioso also considers that the origin of the word flamenco could be in the Arabic expression used in Morocco fellah-mangu, which means "the songs of the peasants". Likewise, Luis Antonio de Vega contributes the expressions "felahikum" and "felah-enkum", which have the same meaning<br></font>
