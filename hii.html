5. Estimado señor/Estimada señora/Estimados señores/Estimadas señoras — Literally, esteemed sir/madam/sirs/madams

The above two greetings are particularly useful for starting a letter when you don’t know the name of the person you’re addressing, like when writing to a company. If you do know the name, just add it, i.e., Estimado Señor Almodóvar.<br>

6. Muy señor mío/Muy señora mía/Muy señores míos/Muy señoras mías — Very much my dear sir/madam/sirs/madams<br>


<b>Goodbyes
There are a few standard ways to end a formal communiqué in Spanish. Keep in mind that your name will go below each of these.<br>

7. Gracias y saludos — Thank you and salutations/greetings.<br></b>

8. Le saludo atentamente — Literally, this means “I sincerely salute/greet you.” If you’re writing to more than one person, use les saludo atentamente.<br>

10. Reciba mi más cordial saludo — Receive my warmest greetings; for more than one person, it’s reciban mi más cordial saludo.<br>

<b>Informal Written Greetings and Goodbyes
Greetings
<b><br>

<b>In letters (that long-dead art, I know) to friends, lovers and family, one writes the following to start things off:<br>

16. Querido/Querida/Queridos/Queridas — This is the past participle of querer, which means to want/love/wish. Here it just means the same as “dear.” It varies according to gender and number as with the greetings we saw earlier.
</b><br>


<b>Goodbyes
And to sign off, these first two are friendly but not too friendly:
</b>

17. Un cordial saludo — Best regards; literally, “a cordial greeting.”<br>
<br>
18. Cordialmente — Sincerely<br>

If you have a closer relationship, or hope to, you might write:<br>
<br>
19. Un fuerte abrazo — A strong hug<br>

20. Un cariñoso saludo — A caring greeting
<br>
21. Besos — Kisses; as we saw earlier, these aren’t necessarily as romantic as Anglophones tend to take them.<br>

22. Te amo — I love you; this one is obviously more romantic.<br>

23. Besos y abrazos — kisses and hugs<br>

<b>As with other languages, most friendly written communication in Spanish is now limited to what you can poke out on your mobile device screen (incidentally, WhatsApp is the most popular service for this in Spain and much of Latin America, thanks to SMS charges). Often, vowels are omitted. (Also check out our excellent full guide to text-message talk in Spanish.)
/<b><br>

24. Hla — Hello (from hola)<br>

25. Q tl? — How are you? (from ¿Qué tal?) I have to admit, a lot of my own Spanish friends do spell this out a bit more as q tal?, but many of them are also over 30.<br>

26. Bs — Kisses (from besos)<br>

27. a10 — Wait, before you read further, can you figure this out on your own? Think about how it’s pronounced… If you guessed adiós (goodbye), congrats!<br>
<br>

<b>Formal Oral Greetings
We discussed the royalty and Spain’s (quite proper) attitude towards them earlier.

Here’s how one would orally great them in theory, as well as how someone should definitely greet (with sarcasm) a friend who’s being a bit pompous:
</b><br>

28. Vuestra Majestad — Your majesty (the archaic version)<br>

29. Su Majestad — Your majesty (the more modern version)<br>

30. Señor Rey — Your majesty the king<br>

31. Señora Reina — Your majesty the queen<br>

32. Majestades/Vuestras Majestades — Your majesties<br>

As for princes or princesses, one humors them with the following:

33. Alteza — Highness<br>

34. Su Alteza — Your Highness<br>

For your average high-falutin’ folks, you can use:<br>
<br>
35. Señor — Mister<br>

36. Señora — Missus
<br>
If you’re having proper adventures in Spain or Latin America, you may eventually need to know how to address a judge:<br>

37. Honorable — Honorable; this can be followed by the judge’s last name, or not.<br>


<b>Informal Oral Greetings
We have previously published an excellent and complete post on greeting your people in more informal ways. Here are the top three to know.
</b><br>

38. ¡Hola! — “Hello!” If you know one word of Spanish, this should be it.<br>
<br>
39. ¿Qué onda, microonda? — “What wave, microwave?” This is an incredibly stupid (or funny, depending on your mindset) way to greet people in Chile, where the more standard ¿Qué onda? (“What’s up?) rules the day.<br>

40. ¿Qué pasa, huevón? — “What’s up, dude?” This is also rather Southern-cone South American.<br>
